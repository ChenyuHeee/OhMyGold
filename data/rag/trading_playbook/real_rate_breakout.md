# Real Rate Breakout Momentum Play

- **Trigger**: 10y TIPS yield breaks below -0.5% and dollar index closes under 50-day moving average.
- **Bias**: Initiate strategic long via COMEX gold futures and GLD call spread overlay.
- **Sizing**: Target 40% of max position limits with initial risk defined by 1.8x ATR(14).
- **Playbook Notes**:
  1. Confirm breadth using GDX/GDXJ relative strength — demand confirmation keeps miners in sync.
  2. Run stress tests against +75 bps real-rate snapback; hedge with 3-month risk reversals if skew cheap.
  3. If physical premiums in Asia spike >6%, allocate 10% of risk to loco swap financing.
- **Monitoring**: Re-evaluate if DXY reclaims 50-day average for two consecutive sessions or if real rates mean-revert above -0.25%.
