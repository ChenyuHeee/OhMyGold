  "body": "Mean reversion setups excel when gold trades in a well-defined channel and realized volatility is contained. Confirm the regime with falling ATR(14) and a neutral macro backdrop (flat real yields). Entries trigger when price stretches beyond 1.5 standard deviations above the 20-day moving average while RSI(14) exceeds 72. Execution favours scaling into 50% risk at the signal close and the balance on a failed follow-through during Asia hours. Stops sit 2.2 standard deviations above the mean to avoid noise. First profit target reverts to the 20-day moving average; secondary target trails VWAP if momentum collapses. Risk desk insists on capping aggregate short gamma by pairing with call spreads whenever cross-asset volatility signals complacency."
