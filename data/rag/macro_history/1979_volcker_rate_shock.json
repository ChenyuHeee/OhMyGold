  "event": "Volcker rate shock",
  "year": 1979,
  "category": "Monetary tightening",
  "body": "In October 1979 the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker shifted to targeting money supply growth, allowing the federal funds rate to jump above 20 percent within months. Inflation expectations had been embedded after a decade of oil shocks and lax policy. Gold, which had already rallied, surged toward 850 dollars per ounce in January 1980 as real yields remained negative and investors searched for inflation insurance. The episode showed that abrupt anti-inflation campaigns can trigger a sharp but temporary spike in bullion prices before policy credibility is restored."
